# Research Notes

Research notes preserve implementation evidence, operational observations, comparisons, and maintainer interpretation that inform the RFCs without becoming normative proposals themselves.

A research note may:

- document production or testnet evidence;
- compare V1 and V2 behavior;
- record failure modes and recovery paths;
- map external implementations to an existing RFC;
- preserve contributor evidence while adding maintainer flags or version context.

Research notes do **not** establish a production commitment, approved API, smart-contract change, or accepted RFC by themselves.

### Provenance note

The first research note retains its original `rfcs/0005-...` path and title because it arrived as a community contribution under that name and the maintainer review intentionally preserved rather than deleted contributor material.

For repository governance, it is classified here as a **Research Note supporting RFC 0004**, not as a normative RFC 0005.
